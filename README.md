## Introduction

Most developers have already heard of DevOps and the rest are surely going to hear about it in the nearest future.

The DevOps concept basically tries to unite system administrators and developers in order to achieve a more efficient operation of hosted solutions. However, introducing DevOps in any organization typically leads to one very important question:

> Which toolchain is right for us?

While we cannot predict your exact requirements, we _can_ tell you why you should go with `STEP`:

1. You want a developer friendly toolchain which just works
1. You want to run web applications written for .Net Core, NodeJS or PHP
1. You want all the common management choices i.e. API, CLI and UI access

Also, `STEP` is completely free and Open Source so why not give it a go?
