## Introduction

Most developers have already heard of DevOps and the rest are most likely going to hear about it in the nearest future.

The concept basically tries to bring system administrators and developers closer together in order to achieve a more efficient operation of the hosted platforms in an organization. However, introducing DevOps in an organization typically also leads to one big question:

> Which toolchain is right for us?

While we cannot predict your needs, we _can_ tell you why you should go with `STEP`:

1. You want a developer friendly toolchain which just works
1. You want to run web applications written for .Net Core, NodeJS or PHP
1. You want all the common management choices i.e. API, CLI and UI access

Also, `STEP` is completely free and Open Source so why not give it a go?
